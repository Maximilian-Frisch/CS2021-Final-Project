                Young Life thinks the world of kids. We believe that they deserve to know what life can hold for them.
                Young Life leaders are caring adults who come sharing that hope as well as fun and lasting friendships with kids.
                From club and camp to Campaigners and other activities, teens have a blast laughing,
                trying new things and being with their friends.

                Leaders are committed to being involved with kids' lives
                -- from supporting them at their sporting events to listening to them talk about what's important to them.
                Our leaders help kids consider the direction of their lives, and they offer hope for their future.
